Rough notes on inspiration and motivation
=========================================


## The background

The pandemic has forced most of us to work from home and it was only
a natural progression that my wife and I had to make some changes to adapt
our work environments.

I've been used to using dual monitors at the office before the pandemic.
I actually have 2 monitors aside from my laptop's display for a total of
3 screens. My home work space is very limited so I requested only 1 of my
monitors be delivered to me. Eventually my wife thought she could use an
extra display as well. I thought maybe I can have my other monitor
delivered as well to lend to her.

Our work desks are very small. Mine's 60x40cm with a 46x36cm folding
table positioned at the back for the monitor. My wife has 1 desk
measured at 80x40cm.

With desk the she has, the monitor and her laptop would eat up almost all
of her table space. Solution: Get a monitor mount. The one's that you clamp
on your desk.

All was well and good but then we realized another problem. Both of my
monitors are those thin bezelled Acers (model: R231bmid) without a vesa
mount! This was easily solved with a generic non-vesa adapter. I didn't
even know about these things until now.

So the mount and adapter arrived and whilst assembling, we realized the
adapter and the mount was not really a good fit for the monitor.

Here are the problems:

- The adapter was blocking off the ports at the back as well as the
  buttons the bottom.
- The bottom dimension and shape of the monitor was curved which gave
  a weird fit for the generic adapter.
- The top dimension of the monitor is so much thinner compared to the
  bottom that the generic adapter was not able to hold it at all.
- The mount does not go low enough for comfortable viewing level.

We eventually we're able to work it out with a little creativity but I
realized this might finally be a good situation to make use of my
3d printer!

## The vesa adapter problem

For days I was musing about how I would go about designing the adapter.
Before that, I don't even know how to use any cad software! (more on this
later).

`<the stages of grief>`

Eventually I thought whether there is an official adapter for this model
that I can just buy. There has to be right? Vesa mounts are pretty
much the standard way to mount displays afterall.

My quest was not very fruitful. Apperently there is none...officially.
There is only one company (Humancentric) who took it upon themselves to
create a vesa adapter for these types of monitors. Luckily my specific
monitor model is supported.

But then it comes with another problem...the price! The initial links I got
was from Amazon and these things costs about US$ 25-35. PH Lazada lists
them around US$ 72-93. There was even that one Shopee seller listing it at
US$ 199!

Onto Thingiverse I go!


## The search for a vesa adapter

Being the noob that I am, I was hoping that I didn't have to start from
scratch.
